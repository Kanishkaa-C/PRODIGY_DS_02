Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship, including their demographics, class, and survival status. The goal of this project is to clean the data, explore relationships between variables, and identify any significant patterns and trends that can help predict passenger survival.

Objectives
Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key relationships between variables.
Visualize data trends such as survival rates based on age, class, sex, and other factors.
Identify potential factors influencing survival outcomes.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
numpy for numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
scikit-learn for machine learning (if applicable for modeling).
jupyter notebook for interactive analysis.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset available from Kaggle.

Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
Description: The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, such as their class, age, sex, survival status, fare paid, and embarked location. It has both training and test sets.
Data Files:
train.csv (contains labeled data for training analysis)
test.csv (contains unlabeled data for predictions, if modeling is performed)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
Required libraries
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Survival Rate: Analyze survival rates based on different features such as Age, Class, Sex, and Pclass.
Correlation Matrix: Examine relationships between variables using correlation matrices.
Data Visualizations:
Bar charts and pie charts for categorical variables.
Histograms and box plots for numerical variables like Age, Fare.
Heatmaps and pairplots for visualizing correlations.
Key Insights & Patterns
Survival rate by Pclass, Sex, and Age.
Distribution of passengers across different classes.
Correlation between features like Fare and Survived.
Missing data patterns and their impact on the analysis.
Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into the Titanic disaster by examining patterns in the dataset. Through data cleaning and EDA, we can uncover significant trends that help understand survival factors, which can serve as a foundation for more advanced modeling (e.g., classification models). This analysis also highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing and visualization in any data science project.
